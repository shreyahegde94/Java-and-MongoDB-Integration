# Java-and-MongoDB-Integration
Implementing a simple program to demonstrate CRUD operations in Mongo DB using the Mongo Java Driver.

Requirements:

• MongoDB community edition from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community.  
• MongoDB compass from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#compass. It provides an effective UI to view your   
  databases, collections and documents and also allows you to perform operations like find(), sort() and so on.  
• Java installed on your system and preferably an IDE such as eclipse or IntelliJ idea.  
• bson-3.2.2 jar file.  
• mongo-java-driver-3.3.0 jar file.  

Steps to run the program:

• Create a new project on your Java IDE with the java code present in JavaMongoIntegration.java.  
• Add the two jar files as external libraries to the java project.  

Results:

• The results to the operations will be dispayed on the Java IDE in JSON format.  
• You can also view the final result of your program in MongoDB by connecting to port 27017 on MongoDB compass.
